# GIS-Python-Scripts
Contains python scripts I've created for my GIS work (run straight from PythonWin, or used in ScriptTools if intended for sharing with colleagues).

I only recently got on GitHub, so I'm still in the process of posting. Check back soon for more examples of my GIS-related python scripts. Thanks!
