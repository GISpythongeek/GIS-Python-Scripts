# GIS-Python-Scripts
Contains python scripts I've created for GIS (to be run with ArcGIS).

I'm a GIS Analyst and cartogrpaher, and I'm currently diving deeper into task automation, so I thought being able to write python scripts was a good skill, in addition to using ModelBuilder (I mainly use ArcGIS).  I hope eventually - after I've become much better at python - to develop some good geoprocessing and workflow scripts.
